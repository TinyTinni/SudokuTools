# Sudoku Tools
Some tools for Sudoku handling.
The tools are standalone and can be combined, the file format is a simple 9x9 csv file, where the unknown entries can be 0 or empty.

Current tools:

- [Image Extractor](./img_extract/) - extracts a sudoku grid from a image file (WIP)
- [Solver](./solver/) - solves a Sudoku
- [svg Generator](./svg_gen/) - generates a displayable svg file from a given Sudoku
- [GUI](./gui/) - A simple gui to generate the csv files
