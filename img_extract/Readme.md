# Image Extractor
A, currently, very basic and WIP sudoku image grid extractor.
Given an image, it will recognize the grid, get the tiles with numbers and print out the numbers.

It is work in progress here, but maybe already interesting.
Not usable yet.

Requires OpenCV.

Requires Pytorch for model training.
